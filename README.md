# Todo-API-Geolocation

This project are meant to be fulfiling the requirements of Doogether company selection test.

## Prerequisite

In this repo you will find my first iteration of building the PokeDex app, and also for you who want to run this app without installing the release version, first thing to do after setup your computer for react native developing environment are install all the dependencies that used by the app by opening terminal and then type.

```npm install``` or ```yarn add```

After all the dependencies are installed, the next step is install one more depedency (please note that the sequence how you install the depedency are important, so keep following this instruction will be good) by typing.

```npm install react-native-paper``` on your terminal.

After all of the dependencies are installed then just type ```react-native run-android```on your terminal.
